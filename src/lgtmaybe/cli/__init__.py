"""CLI for lgtmaybe.

This package is split into three layers:

- ``runtime`` / ``render`` — small, pure helpers (call-time options, output
  formatting).
- this module — the *logic*: parsing, adapter/provider wiring, and the
  ``execute_*`` entry points that the commands call. Kept together so the
  pipeline stages resolve (and can be patched in tests) as one namespace.
- ``commands`` — the Click command + option declarations, imported at the
  bottom to register onto the groups defined here.
