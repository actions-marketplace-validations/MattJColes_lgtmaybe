"""Slash commands triggered by an ``issue_comment`` event.

A PR comment like ``/review`` or ``/ask why is this slow?`` routes to the same
engine and provider as the main CLI. ``/review`` and ``/improve`` post a review;
``/ask`` and ``/describe`` reply in-thread with an issue comment.

The diff is always redacted and wrapped as untrusted input before it reaches the
provider — a PR comment is no more trusted than the diff itself.
