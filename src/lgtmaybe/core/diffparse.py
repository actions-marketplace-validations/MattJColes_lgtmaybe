"""Unified-diff parsing primitives.

One home for the regexes and helpers that read a ``git diff``: splitting a diff
into per-file patches and parsing hunk headers. Shared by the engine (batching,
hunk expansion) and the github adapter (position map) so the patterns and their
off-by-one rules live in exactly one place.
