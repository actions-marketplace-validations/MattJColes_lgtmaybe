"""Shared test fixtures.

Provider-credential env vars leak in from the developer's shell or the CI runner
and make the credential resolver non-deterministic: a real ``OPENAI_API_KEY`` in
the environment would turn a "missing key must raise" test green by accident, and
a stray ``AWS_*`` var would make a "bedrock needs ambient creds" test pass when it
should fail. Clear them by default; a test that needs one sets it explicitly via
``monkeypatch.setenv``.
