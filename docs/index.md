# lgtmaybe

</div>

Provider-agnostic PR reviewer. Six providers, one flag, and no static keys for
cloud providers. It posts inline comments and a summary straight onto the pull
request.

lgtmaybe reviews the lines a change touches, and it runs in two places: as a
GitHub Action on a pull request, or locally from the command line against your
`git` diff before you push. As an Action it fetches the diff from the GitHub API
and never checks out or runs your code; locally it reads your working branch.
Either way it pads each change with a few surrounding lines, so a finding lands
with the function around it in view, but it only ever comments on the lines that
actually changed.

Reviews surface the things you'd want a careful reviewer to catch:

- **Logic and correctness bugs** — edge cases, null/None dereferences, off-by-one and boundary errors, mismatched or inverted ranges, unhandled error paths, races and TOCTOU, missed `await`s, and numeric or timezone bugs.
- **Security vulnerabilities** — an OWASP-aligned sweep: injection, XSS, CSRF and open redirects, hardcoded secrets, broken authn/authz (including JWT pitfalls), path traversal, unrestricted uploads, SSRF, insecure deserialization and XXE, mass assignment, weak crypto, resource/DoS safety (including ReDoS), secrets or PII (passwords, tokens, SSNs, card data) leaking into logs, and CI/IaC misconfiguration.
- **Missing or weak tests** — changed code paths shipped without a test (flagged with a suggested test to drop in), and tests that don't really test: assertion-free, over-mocked, or sleep-based.
- **Documentation gaps and stale docs** — public APIs added without a docstring, names that contradict what the code does, and docstrings or comments the change just made wrong.
- **Deprecated and end-of-life code** — deprecated APIs, end-of-life or vulnerable dependencies, and typosquat-looking additions, flagged when the diff shows them (with the modern replacement suggested where known).
- **Intent** — does the PR do what it says? The PR title, description, and commit names (or your local `git log` commit names on the CLI) are compared against the diff, flagging out-of-scope hunks, contradictions, and promised behaviour that never lands.

Every finding is graded from `info` up to `critical`, so you can set the
severity floor that matters to you, and each one lands as an inline comment on
the exact line where the problem is, with a single summary at the top. On the CLI
the same findings print to your terminal — ready to read, or to hand to an AI
agent to apply. Generated files and binaries are skipped, secrets are redacted
and the diff is treated as untrusted input (hardened against prompt injection)
before anything leaves for the model, and a clean PR just gets a 👍 **LGTM!**.
